Overview
- employ group theory to solve rubik's cube
- convert between 3D model of cube and 3D matrix representation of it
- use three.js, html, css to display the cube


Frontend: 
- 3d cube where the user can input the colours
- check for validity 
- send the 3d matrix to the backend, 
    - {
        F : {front matrix}, 
        B : {back matrix},
        etc...
    }
- backend -> frontend set of step in rubix cube notation
- carousel to go back and forth 


Overview

This project implements a Rubik's Cube solving algorithm based on concepts from group theory. The cube is represented as a 3D matrix in Python, allowing for efficient manipulation and computation of moves. The solving process is visualized using a 3D interactive model built with Three.js, styled with HTML and CSS. The goal is to provide both a mathematically grounded solution method and an intuitive, dynamic visualization of the solving steps.

Group theory

In mathemetics, groups are defined to be some set G that conforms to certain axioms after applying binary operations. These axioms include closure, associativity, identity element and inverse. In context of rubik's cube, the groups can be defined as different sides of the Rubik's cube, where each element in a group is different sides of the Rubik's cube. For instance, F would refer to the front side of the cube and rotating it in a clockwise direction. We can use prime(') notation to indicate counterclockwise movement such as F'. A 180 degree roation is noted by 2 following the move letter such as F2.

The Rubik's cube solving algorithm in this project follows human thistlethwaite algorithm, which solves scrambled rubiks cube(denoted as G0) by ensuring edge orientation(deonted as G1), corner orientation(denoted as G2) and permutation parity(denoted as G3).

- G0 is the full set of all possible solvable cube states, and it includes any state that can be generated from the solved cube using moves F, B, L, R, U, D
- G1 is achieved when all edges are in correct position and it is a subgroup of all cube shape generated by moves F2, B2, L, R, U, D from solved cube.
- G2 is achieved when all corners are in correct position and it is subgroup of all cube shape generated by moves F2, B2, L2, R2, U, D from solved cube.
- G3 is achieved when cube has achieved permutation parity(solvable by only using 180 degree turns) and thus is subgroup of all cube shape generated by F2, B2, L2, R2, U2, D2.

Future Improvements:
- visual recognition of the cube
